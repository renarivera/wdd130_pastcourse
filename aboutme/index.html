    <p>Hi there, I'm Renato Rivera and I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Professional Studies at BYU Idaho. In the future, I would like to change my career to freelance and travel the world. I fully believe that if we are in this world, it is to discover it. I love programming and consider web development and design to be one of the most in-demand fields to work in remotely.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I like to play the violin or take pictures of sunsets, animals, etc. I enjoy reading a lot, my favorite author is Isabell Allende, she is from Chile, I am currently reading 'Beyond Winter' or 'Más Allá del Invierno'. </p>
    <p>Currently, I am a Data Analyst in Ecuador, next month I will finish my degree as an Economist at a University in my Country Ecuador. For the next few months, I am preparing myself to grow in the company I work for, to move up to a Data Scientist position.</p>
    <p>I have been member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 16 years, my favorite quote is “If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience … , he will have so much the advantage in the world to come” (D&C 130:19). I remember this quote before to start the day, each day.</p>
